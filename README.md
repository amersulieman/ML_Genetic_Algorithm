# ML_Genetic_Algorithm

To run the algorithm, you need to install the requirements!

    pip3 install -r requirements

Then you just have to run the file genetic_algorithm.py
python3 genetic_algorithm.py

This will produce an output of each generation's best fitness.
The output will be placed in a file called Output_SGA.txt
