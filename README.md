# ML_Genetic_Algorithm

    A population-based nondeterministic search algorithm,
    named Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA), which will maximize
    the equation shown in 'equation_solving_for.png' file

To run the algorithm, you need to install the requirements!

    pip3 install -r requirements

Then you just have to run the file genetic_algorithm.py

    python3 genetic_algorithm.py

This will produce an output of each generation's best fitness.
The output will be placed in a file called Output_SGA.txt
